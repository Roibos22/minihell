# minihell

Work In Progress

The "42 Minishell" project is an assignment where students of the 42 coding school build a simple Unix shell in C. The objective is to create a command-line interface that can parse and execute commands, handle paths, and implement a set of built-in functions. This project involves understanding process creation and management, signals, and the overall architecture of a shell environment, providing students with a deeper insight into system programming and command-line tools' inner workings.
